    <hr/><p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
    <p>ODU offers a number of courses via the internet. A common  requirement among these courses is for a system of online assessment. An  assessment is any form of graded question-and-answer activity. Examples  include exams, quizzes, exercises, and self-assessments. In preparation  for automating such a system, our group has undertaken a study of  assessment techniques in traditional classrooms.</p>
    <p>An assessment can contain a number of questions. Questions come in  many forms, including true/false, single-choice from among multiple  alternatives, multiple choices, fill-in-the-blank, and essay. There may be  other forms as well.</p>
    <p>Students take assessments that are administered by instructors. The  students’ responses to each question are collected by the instructor, who  grades them by comparison to a rubric for each question. The instructor  may also elect to provide feedback (written comments), particularly about  incorrect responses.</p>
    <p>A total score for the assessment is computed by the instructor. If  this is a self-assessment, the score is for informational purposes only.  For other kinds of assessments, the instructor records the score in  his/her grade book.</p>
    <p>Information is returned to the student about their performance. At a  minimum, the student would learn of their score and any  instructor-provided feedback. Depending upon the instructor, students may  also receive the questions, a copy of their own responses, and the  instructor’s correct answer.</p>
