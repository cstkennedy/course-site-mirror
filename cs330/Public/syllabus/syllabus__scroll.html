    <a id="catalogdescription"/><h2 id="catalog-description">1.1 Catalog Description</h2><p>Laboratory work required. The techniques and idioms of object-oriented programming in C++ and Java. Methods of object-oriented analysis and design with the Unified Modeling Language. Multi-thread programs, synchronization, and graphic user interfaces</p>
    <a id="overalldescription"/><h2 id="overall-description">1.2 Overall Description</h2><p>Throughout this course we will discuss various best practices and object-oriented design patterns. As part of this journey… we will endeavor to do the following:</p>
    <ol>
  <li>
  <p>develop the skill set to learn new languages <em>on the fly</em> based on existing  knowledge</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>leverage existing knowledge to reason about code written in an unfamiliar  language</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>analyze design patterns that are common between languages</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>identify <em>emergent</em> properties of object-oriented code</p>
    </li>
</ol><h2 id="prerequisites">1.3 Prerequisites</h2><p>The prerequisites for this course are:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>CS 250, Programming with C++; or CS 251, Programming and Problem Solving in Java; or CS 253, Transfer Credit for Programming with Python</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p><a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs252/latest/" target="_blank">CS 252</a>, Introduction to Unix for Programmers</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>Note that, if it has been some time since you took CS 251, or if you received weak grades in the course, you may need to do some review work to prepare for this class.</p>
    <p>If you are a transfer student who took equivalent courses elsewhere, you would do well to review the material on those course websites and look for topics that may not have been covered in your prior courses, because course “equivalence” is often a very rough approximation. <strong>Pay particular attention to the material on design, testing, and debugging</strong>, as these are often given short shrift at other institutions.</p>
    <p>Either way, if you need to review any of the prerequisite topics described below, the time to do so is early in the semester, <em>before</em> you need it to understand the lectures or are called to use it in assignments.</p>
    <a id="generalprogrammingknowledge"/><h3 id="general-programming-knowledge">1.3.1 General Programming Knowledge</h3><p>Students should be familiar with certain basic programming techniques that are largely independent of any specific programming language:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>using editors, compilers and other basic software development tools.</li>
  <li>basic software design (i.e., stepwise refinement and top-down design)</li>
  <li>software testing, including the use of scaffolding code (stubs and drivers), selection of test cases for black-box testing, and head to head testing</li>
  <li>debugging, including the use of debugging output, the use of automatic debuggers to set breakpoints and trace program execution, and the general process of reasoning backwards from failure locations to the faulty code responsible for the failure</li>
</ul><a id="cknowledge"/><h3 id="c-knowledge">1.3.2 C++ Knowledge</h3><p>No prior knowledge of C++ is assumed. C++ will be discussed as a point of comparison (i.e., for perspective and context). However, you will not be tested on your ability to write C++ code. </p>
    <a id="javaknowledge"/><h3 id="java-knowledge">1.3.3 Java Knowledge</h3><p>I will assume that you are familiar with the basics of Java. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>the various Java statements and control-flow constructs,</li>
  <li>the built-in data types,</li>
  <li>the use of arrays, pointers, pointers to arrays, and linked lists,</li>
  <li>the use and writing of functions, and</li>
  <li>the basic use of structs and/or classes for implementing  abstract data types.</li>
</ul><a id="python3rustknowledge"/><h3 id="python-3-rust-knowledge">1.3.4 Python 3 &amp; Rust Knowledge</h3><p>In general, CS students at the 300 level should be able to pick up new programming languages with only moderate effort.</p>
    <p>Prior knowledge of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Rust</a> is neither expected nor assumed.</p>
    <a id="unixlinux"/><h3 id="unix-linux">1.3.5 Unix/Linux</h3><p>All students in the course will receive accounts on the CS Dept. network, and knowledge of how to work with the Linux servers is part of the course prerequisites. This course does not require familiarity with shell scripting. All other topics in CS 252 are required.</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Some assignments will require the use of software available only on the Linux servers. Others may require (or, at least, be simplified by) use of the X windowing system.</p>
    
</blockquote><a id="generalcomputerliteracy"/><h3 id="general-computer-literacy">1.3.6 General Computer Literacy</h3><p>You will be studying techniques in this course for preparing professional-quality software documentation. The key embedded word in “software documentation” is “document”. Students taking this course should be able to use word processors and other common tools to produce good quality documents, including mixing text and graphics in a natural and professional manner.</p>

  <li>Python: 3.11</li>
</ul><a id="courseobjectives"/><h1 id="course-objectives">3 Course Objectives</h1><p>This course will explore the techniques of object-oriented programming, analysis, and design. The emphasis will be upon the development of clean interfaces that permit easy modification and reuse of software components. Other techniques, drawn from outside the object-oriented approach, that significantly contribute to this goal will also be discussed.</p>
    <p>Students will gain facility in object-oriented programming languages and will learn the constructs that differentiate such languages from others. This course will explore the idioms and styles of object-oriented programming in Java, Python, and Rust with emphasis upon how these contribute to reusable software components.</p>
    <p>Students will learn how to use object-oriented techniques in support of programming. In particular, students will be introduced to the process of object-oriented analysis as a means of understanding an unfamiliar problem domain. Students will learn to build and use models, expressed in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to codify and evaluate that understanding and to evolve system requirements. Students will learn how to use those models to facilitate a smooth transition from analysis to design and from there to implementation.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p><code>((sum of all assignment grades) - (lowest assignment grade)) / (number of assignments - 1)</code></p>

</blockquote><h2 id="assignments">5.2 Assignments</h2><p>Assignments for this course will include <em>programming assignments</em>, which must be done on an individual basis.</p>
    <a id="assignmentgrading"/><h3 id="assignment-grading">5.2.1 Assignment Grading</h3><p>Assignments will be turned in through the CS submission system, rather than through Canvas–more information is available <a class="doc" href="../../Public/submitting/index.html" target="CS330_Public">here</a>. Most of the assignments will be graded by an automatic grader. The results will be sent to your ODU email account. </p>
    <p>Unless the assignment explicitly states otherwise, you may submit a total of three times per assignment; the instructor will take the last of the marks, although you may request that your score be “rolled back” to an earlier one. You may NOT submit after viewing the sample solution.</p>
    <a id="autogradertesting"/><h3 id="auto-grader-testing">5.2.2 Auto-Grader &amp; Testing</h3><p>Test driven development is a topic of particular import–not only in academia, but in industry.</p>
    <p><em>You will be expected to make use of Blackbox Testing</em>. This is a topic of particular import. Blackbox testing is covered in CS 250–a prerequisite for this course. You will also need to make use of white-box testing and unit testing.</p>
    <p><strong>All tests are designed by me–the instructor.</strong> The Auto-Grader runs tests that I use to evaluate my solution. These tests evaluate mechanics of import–e.g., dynamic binding and function overloading.</p>
    <p>Be systematic in all changes to your assignment solution and modifications to your tests. Do not haphazardly make changes to an assignment and resubmit hoping for a better grade. Treat each submission attempt as your final submission. Ask for guidance before each subsequent submission.</p>
    <h2 id="exams">5.3 Exams</h2><p>The Midterm Exam and Final Exam will be administered online via Canvas.</p>
    <a id="incompletegrades"/><h2 id="incomplete-grades">5.4 Incomplete Grades</h2><p>A grade of “I” indicates assigned work yet to be completed in a given course, or absence from the final examination, and is assigned only upon instructor approval of a student request. The “I” grade may be awarded only in exceptional circumstances beyond the student’s control. The “I” grade becomes an “F” if not removed by the day grades are due for following term based on specific criteria: <a href="https://ww1.odu.edu/academics/academic-records/grades/incompletes-withdraws-zgrades">Incomplete, Withdraws and Z grades.</a>.</p>

This will allow you sufficient time to address any issues, refine your testing process, and discuss your solution with me during my office hours.</p>
    <p>I expect every student to discuss each assignment with me at least once.</p>
    <a id="reviewrecordingsrecordedlectures"/><h2 id="review-recordings-recorded-lectures-">6.2 Review Recordings (Recorded Lectures)</h2><p>Recorded Reviews are included in the course outline. These are, in general, condensed versions of my live lectures. The full set of recorded Reviews is available <a href="https://github.com/cstkennedy/cs330-examples">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Exceptions will be made only in situations of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the student’s control, and such arrangements must be made prior to the due date in any situations where the conflict is foreseeable.</p>
    <p>“<em>I’ve fallen behind and can’t catch up</em>”, “<em>I’m having a busier semester than I expected</em>”, or “<em>I registered for too many classes this semester</em>” are <span class="emph">not</span> grounds for an extension.</p>
    <p>Extensions to due dates will not be granted simply to allow “porting” from one system to another. “<em>But I had it working on my home PC!</em>” is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
    <a id="academichonesty"/><h2 id="academic-honesty">7.2 Academic Honesty</h2><p>Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own work. If an assignment is <strong>explicitly</strong> described as a team assignment, it must be the work of the team members only.</p>
    <p>The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and to use his evaluation of the student’s understanding of the assignment and of the submitted solution as evidence of cheating. Violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Academic Integrity for consideration for possible punitive action.</p>
    <p>Students who contribute to violations by sharing their code/designs with others may be subject to the same penalties.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Students are expected to use standard Unix protection mechanisms (<code>chmod</code>) to  keep their assignments from being read by their classmates. Failure to do so will result in grade penalties, at the very least.</li>
</ul><p>This policy is <span class="emph">not</span> intended to prevent students from providing legitimate assistance to one another. Students are encouraged to seek/provide one another aid in learning to use the operating system, in issues pertaining to the programming language, or to general issues relating to the course subject matter.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s  ideas, you must cite your sources appropriately. Within code, such  citations appear in comments.</p>

    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s  words (code), you must cite your sources appropriately <strong>and</strong> mark  the quoted text. Within code, such  citations appear in comments.</p>

  <p>The overall principle stated in the first sentence of this section remains in  effect. “Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own  work.” If the bulk of your assignment, project, test answer, etc., are  copied, even with appropriate citation, to the degree that, in the judgment of  the instructor, you have not demonstrated your own knowledge of the course  material, you will receive a zero for that submission.</p>
