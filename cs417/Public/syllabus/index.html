    <a id="overalldescription"/><h2 id="overall-description">1.2 Overall Description</h2><p>Computer Science involves a fair bit of math and logic. However, most students have a misplaced fear of or frustration with mathematics…</p>
    <ol>
  <li>
  <p>Many students look at a math problem, see unfamiliar notation, and <em>psyche  themselves out</em>.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>Many students hear the word <em>“proof”</em> and have no idea where to start.</p>
    </li>
</ol><p>My overarching goals are…</p>
    <ol>
  <li>
  <p>to help you build the intuition that you need to make use of your existing  math knowledge.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>to help you develop an intuition for constructing and analyzing proofs.</p>

  <li>
  <p>to develop a natural curiosity along with a strong foundation for further  mathematical endeavors.</p>

</ol><h2 id="prerequisites">1.3 Prerequisites</h2><p>Students are expected to have a strong foundation in mathematics and programming:</p>
    <ol>
  <li><strong>Math 316</strong> - Good understanding of calculus and linear algebra.</li>
  <li><strong>CS 250 or CS 251 or CS 253</strong> - Programming skills in a language such as: C/C++, Python, Rust, or Java.</li>
</ol><a id="generalprogrammingknowledge"/><h3 id="general-programming-knowledge">1.3.1 General Programming Knowledge</h3><p>Students should be familiar with certain basic programming techniques that are largely independent of any specific programming language:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>using editors, compilers and other basic software development tools.</li>
  <li>basic software design (i.e., stepwise refinement and top-down design)</li>
  <li>software testing, including the use of scaffolding code (stubs and drivers), selection of test cases for black-box testing, and head to head testing.</li>
  <li>debugging, including the use of debugging output, the use of automatic debuggers to set breakpoints and trace program execution, and the general process of reasoning backwards from failure locations to the faulty code responsible for the failure.</li>
</ul><a id="ccjavapythonorrustknowledge"/><h3 id="c-c-java-python-or-rust-knowledge">1.3.2 C, C++, Java, Python, or Rust Knowledge</h3><p>I will assume that you are familiar with the basics of C, C++, Java, Python, or Rust. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>the various statements and control-flow constructs,</li>
  <li>the built-in data types,</li>
  <li>the use of arrays, pointers, pointers to arrays, and linked lists,</li>

    <p>We discuss various notations (for math and pseudocode) in this course. Keep in  mind <em>“That it is just notation.”</em> Familiarizing oneself with unfamiliar notations is a skill we will endeaver to develop this semester.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have questions… Ask the instructor</strong> The cliché <em>“If you have a question… at least one of your classmates has the same question.”</em> is true (especially this semester).</p>

Each such submission must take the form of a single multi-page PDF document. <strong>Failure to follow these requirements will result in a zero.</strong></p>
    <p>All work must be readable. Make sure that all submitted PDFs are readable, e.g.,</p>
    <ul>
  <li>content is not cut off</li>
  <li>writing (or text) is not faded (i.e., too light to read)</li>
</ul><p>Problems must be submitted in order. Any scans with the problems listed out of order will result in a zero.</p>

    <p>The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and to use his evaluation of the student’s understanding of the assignment and of the submitted solution as evidence of cheating. Violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Academic Integrity for consideration for possible punitive action.</p>
    <p>Students who contribute to violations by sharing their code/designs with others may be subject to the same penalties.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Students are expected to use standard Unix protection mechanisms (<code>chmod</code>) to  keep their assignments from being read by their classmates. Failure to do so will result in grade penalties, at the very least.</li>
</ul><p>This policy is <span class="emph">not</span> intended to prevent students from providing legitimate assistance to one another. Students are encouraged to seek/provide one another aid in learning to use the operating system, in issues pertaining to the programming language, or to general issues relating to the course subject matter.</p>

  <p>Students should avoid, however, explicit discussion of approaches to solving a particular programming assignment, and under no circumstances should students show one another their code for an ongoing assignment, nor discuss such code in detail.</p>

    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s ideas, you must cite  your sources appropriately. Within code, such citations appear in comments.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>&#x22ee;
double x = 23.0;
double xsqrt = sqrt(x);
// Search algorithm based upon code by S Zeil at
// https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
int loc = 0;
while (loc &lt; arraySize &amp;&amp; numbers[loc] &lt; xsqrt)
&#x22ee;
</code></pre>

    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s words (code), you  must cite your sources appropriately <strong>and</strong> mark the quoted text. Within  code, such citations appear in comments.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>&#x22ee;
double x = 23.0;
double xsqrt = sqrt(x);

// Begin quoted code from  S Zeil at
// https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
int loc = 0;
while (loc &lt; listLength &amp;&amp; list[loc] &lt; searchItem)
{
    ++loc;
}
// End quoted code

&#x22ee;

  <p>Failure to appropriately cite any such “found code” will be taken as evidence  of plagiarism.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>The overall principle stated in the first sentence of this section remains in  effect. “Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own  work.” If the bulk of your assignment, code, paper, etc., are  copied, even with appropriate citation, to the degree that, in the judgment of  the instructor, you have not demonstrated your own knowledge of the course  material, you will receive a zero for that exercise.</p>
