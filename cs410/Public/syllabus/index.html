    <a id="catalogdescription"/><h2 id="catalog-description">1.1 Catalog Description</h2><p>Laboratory work required. Provides students with challenges of business environments in developing a technology based project. Students identify a societal problem, identify solutions, define project solutions, develop project objectives, conduct feasibility analysis, establish organizational group structure to meet project objectives and develop formal specifications. Students make formal technical project presentations and develop web documentation. Students prepare a draft grant proposal. </p>
    <a id="overalldescription"/><h2 id="overall-description">1.2 Overall Description</h2><p>You will work with a team to identify a societal problem, propose a software solution, refine that software solutione, and defend that software solution. Once you have designed a real-world solution… your team (and you) will work to reduce the scope of the project into something that can be prototyped next semester in CS 411W.</p>
    <h2 id="prerequisites">1.3 Prerequisites</h2><ul>
  <li>Students must have earned a C or better in CS350 <em>or</em> be currently enrolled in CS350.</li>
</ul><a id="generalprogrammingknowledge"/><h3 id="general-programming-knowledge">1.3.1 General Programming Knowledge</h3><p>Students should be familiar with certain basic programming techniques that are largely independent of any specific programming language:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>using editors, compilers and other basic software development tools.</li>
  <li>basic software design (i.e., stepwise refinement and top-down design)</li>
  <li>software testing, including the use of scaffolding code (stubs and drivers), selection of test cases for black-box testing, and head to head testing.</li>
  <li>debugging, including the use of debugging output, the use of automatic debuggers to set breakpoints and trace program execution, and the general process of reasoning backwards from failure locations to the faulty code responsible for the failure.</li>
</ul><a id="cjavaknowledge"/><h3 id="c-java-knowledge">1.3.2 C++ &amp; Java Knowledge</h3><p>I will assume that you are familiar with the basics of C++ or Java. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>the various C++ statements and control-flow constructs,</li>
  <li>the built-in data types,</li>
  <li>the use of arrays, pointers, pointers to arrays, and linked lists,</li>
  <li>the use and writing of functions, and</li>
  <li>the basic use of structs and/or classes for implementing  abstract data types.</li>
</ul><a id="python3rustknowledge"/><h3 id="python-3-rust-knowledge">1.3.3 Python 3 &amp; Rust Knowledge</h3><p>Prior knowledge of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Rust</a> is neither expected nor assumed.</p>
    <p>In general, CS students at the 400 level should be able to pick up new programming languages with only moderate effort. If you need resources to get started with Python… take some time to work through the <a href="https://cstkennedy.github.io/course-site-mirror/cs263">CS 263 materials</a></p>
    <a id="unixlinux"/><h3 id="unix-linux">1.3.4 Unix/Linux</h3><p>All students in the course will receive accounts on the CS Dept. network, and knowledge of how to work with the Linux servers is part of the course prerequisites. This course does not require familiarity with shell scripting. All other topics in CS 252 are required.</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Some assignments will require the use of software available only on the Linux servers. Others may require (or, at least, be simplified by) use of the X windowing system.</p>
    
</blockquote><a id="generalcomputerliteracy"/><h3 id="general-computer-literacy">1.3.5 General Computer Literacy</h3><p>You will be studying techniques in this course for preparing professional-quality software documentation. The key embedded word in “software documentation” is “document”. Students taking this course should be able to use word processors and other common tools to produce good quality documents, including mixing text and graphics in a natural and professional manner.</p>
    <a id="whenandwhere"/><h2 id="when-and-where">1.4 When and Where</h2><p>Scheduled Recitation Meetings will be held via Zoom. Meeting information can be found in Canvas under <em>Course Collaboration Tool.</em> Recordings of these meetings will be available under <em>Media Gallery.</em></p>

    <p>If you have had a CS Unix account in the recent past, you should find it still active with your login name, password, and files unchanged. If you have had an account and it has not been restored, contact the CS Dept systems staff at <a href="mailto:root@cs.odu.edu">root@cs.odu.edu</a> requesting that it be restored.</p>

    <a id="courseobjectives"/><h1 id="course-objectives">3 Course Objectives</h1><p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will have participated in the development of a set of documents that define a proposed research solution to a defined problem supported by formal presentations. Students will be required to use a combination of </p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>knowledge gained from the series of courses completed at university</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>external experience from business or industry,</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>research efforts of the specific problem areas that are identified by mentors.</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>The problem contains aspects of requirements that a project manager would be required to solve in a commercial or research environment. Students will develop plans, analysis documents, and design documents for the various aspects of the project solution.</p>
    <p>The use of current technology in the support of the design and development of the problem solution is a critical component of the process. Students will take on the role of project managers and be required to develop management level briefings through formal presentations.</p>
    <p>The development of these briefings is expected to require research along with interviews of experts in the particular domain. One or more presentations will be a critical design review that seeks the approval for continuation of the project.</p>
    <p>The various presentations will require students to work as individuals making a presentation, members of a team to prepare a group presentation as well as leaders of group efforts in support of the overall project.</p>

  <li>contribute meaningfully to development of presentation materials</li>
</ol><a id="duedatesandlatesubmissions"/><h2 id="due-dates-and-late-submissions">7.2 Due Dates and Late Submissions</h2><p>Late papers, assignments, projects, and make-up exams will not normally be permitted.</p>
    <p>Exceptions will be made only in situations of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the student’s control, and such arrangements must be made prior to the due date in any situations where the conflict is foreseeable.</p>
    <p>“<em>I’ve fallen behind and can’t catch up</em>”, “<em>I’m having a busier semester than I expected</em>”, or “<em>I registered for too many classes this semester</em>” are <span class="emph">not</span> grounds for an extension.</p>
    <p>Extensions to due dates will not be granted simply to allow “porting” from one system to another. “<em>But I had it working on my home PC!</em>” is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
    <a id="groupmembership"/><h2 id="group-membership">7.3 Group Membership</h2><p>You will be assigned to a team consisting of five (5) to nine (9) students. The assignment will be based on:</p>

  <li>
  <p>select a CS 411W lecture and recitation taught by your CS 410 teacher</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>try to select the same recitation as your team</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Language that is abusive, harassing, or threatening to members of the class or that fosters high levels of personal and emotional anxiety may, at the instructor’s discretion, result in expulsion from the team. Given the importance of the team project to this course, that is likely to result in a failing grade. Egregious or repeated violations will be referred to appropriate authorities for possible disciplinary action.</p>
    
</blockquote><a id="unsatisfactoryperformance"/><h2 id="unsatisfactory-performance">7.7 Unsatisfactory Performance</h2><p>If a student fails to contribute meaningfully within his/her group, or a student feels he/she cannot contribute meaningfully within his/her group, the instructor or student may arrange a meeting. The meeting may be conducted face-to-face, via network conferencing, or via email. The instructor may consult other CS 410/411W instructors or ask other CS 410/411W instructors to attend the meeting.</p>
    <p>During the meeting the instructor and student will discuss the student’s current contributions and expected contributions moving forward. The instructor and student will arrange a follow-up meeting. If by the follow-up meeting, the student has not made the expected (i.e., agreed upon) contributions he/she may not pass the course.</p>
    <a id="academichonesty"/><h2 id="academic-honesty">7.8 Academic Honesty</h2><p>Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own work. If an assignment is <strong>explicitly</strong> described as a team assignment, it must be the work of the team members only.</p>
    <p>The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and to use his evaluation of the student’s understanding of the assignment and of the submitted solution as evidence of cheating. Violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Academic Integrity for consideration for possible punitive action.</p>
    <p>Students who contribute to violations by sharing their code/designs with others may be subject to the same penalties.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Students are expected to use standard Unix protection mechanisms (<code>chmod</code>) to  keep their assignments from being read by their classmates. Failure to do so will result in grade penalties, at the very least.</li>
</ul><p>This policy is <span class="emph">not</span> intended to prevent students from providing legitimate assistance to one another. Students are encouraged to seek/provide one another aid in learning to use the operating system, in issues pertaining to the programming language, or to general issues relating to the course subject matter.</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Students should avoid, however, explicit discussion of approaches to solving a particular programming assignment, and under no circumstances should students show one another their code for an ongoing assignment, nor discuss such code in detail.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s ideas, you must cite  your sources appropriately. Within code, such citations appear in comments.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>&#x22ee;
double x = 23.0;
double xsqrt = sqrt(x);
// Search algorithm based upon code by S Zeil at
// https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
int loc = 0;
while (loc &lt; arraySize &amp;&amp; numbers[loc] &lt; xsqrt)
&#x22ee;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s words (code), you  must cite your sources appropriately <strong>and</strong> mark the quoted text. Within  code, such citations appear in comments.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>&#x22ee;
double x = 23.0;
double xsqrt = sqrt(x);

// Begin quoted code from  S Zeil at
// https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
int loc = 0;
while (loc &lt; listLength &amp;&amp; list[loc] &lt; searchItem)
{
    ++loc;
}
// End quoted code

&#x22ee;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Failure to appropriately cite any such “found code” will be taken as evidence  of plagiarism.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>The overall principle stated in the first sentence of this section remains in  effect. “Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own  work.” If the bulk of your assignment, code, paper, etc., are  copied, even with appropriate citation, to the degree that, in the judgment of  the instructor, you have not demonstrated your own knowledge of the course  material, you will receive a zero for that exercise.</p>
