</blockquote><h2 id="assignments">5.1 Assignments</h2><p>Assignments for this course will include <em>programming assignments</em> (in Python) which must be done on an individual basis.</p>
    <a id="assignmentgrading"/><h3 id="assignment-grading">5.1.1 Assignment Grading</h3><p>Assignments will be turned in through a combination of the CS submission system or through Canvas. Each assignment will include submission instructions.</p>
    <p>Unless the assignment explicitly states otherwise, you may submit a total of three times per assignment; the instructor will take the last of the marks, although you may request that your score be “rolled back” to an earlier one. You may <strong>not</strong> submit after viewing the sample solution (if one is provided).</p>
    <p>Most of the assignments will be graded by an automatic grader. The results will be sent to your ODU email account. </p>
    <a id="autogradertesting"/><h3 id="auto-grader-testing">5.1.2 Auto-Grader &amp; Testing</h3><p>Test driven development is a topic of particular import–not only in academia, but in industry.</p>
    <p><em>You will be expected to make use of Blackbox Testing</em>. This is a topic of particular import. Blackbox testing is covered in CS 251–a prerequisite for this course. You will also need to make use of white-box testing and unit testing.</p>
    <p><strong>All tests are designed by me–the instructor.</strong> The Auto-Grader runs tests that I use to evaluate my solution. These tests evaluate mechanics of import–e.g., dynamic binding and function overloading.</p>
    <p>Be systematic in all changes to your assignment solution and modifications to your tests. Do not haphazardly make changes to an assignment and resubmit hoping for a better grade. Treat each submission attempt as your final submission. Ask for guidance before each subsequent submission.</p>
    <h2 id="exams">5.2 Exams</h2><p>Exams will be administered online via Canvas.</p>
    <a id="incompletegrades"/><h2 id="incomplete-grades">5.3 Incomplete Grades</h2><p>A grade of “I” indicates assigned work yet to be completed in a given course, or absence from the final examination, and is assigned only upon instructor approval of a student request. The “I” grade may be awarded only in exceptional circumstances beyond the student’s control. The “I” grade becomes an “F” if not removed by the day grades are due for following term based on specific criteria: <a href="https://ww1.odu.edu/academics/academic-records/grades/incompletes-withdraws-zgrades">Incomplete, Withdraws and Z grades.</a>.</p>
    <h1 id="expectations">6 Expectations</h1><a id="assignmentexpectations"/><h2 id="assignment-expectations">6.1 Assignment Expectations</h2><p><strong>It is my expectation that you have completed approximately 70% of each assignment once half the allotted time has passed.</strong> For a two week assignment this would be one week. This will allow you sufficient time to address any issues, refine your testing process, and discuss your solution with me during my office hours.</p>
    <p>I expect every student to discuss each assignment with me at least once.</p>
    <a id="coursepolicies"/><h1 id="course-policies">7 Course Policies</h1><a id="duedatesandlatesubmissions"/><h2 id="due-dates-and-late-submissions">7.1 Due Dates and Late Submissions</h2><p>Late papers, assignments, projects, and make-up exams will not normally be permitted.</p>
    <p>Exceptions will be made only in situations of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the student’s control, and such arrangements must be made prior to the due date in any situations where the conflict is foreseeable.</p>
    <p>“<em>I’ve fallen behind and can’t catch up</em>”, “<em>I’m having a busier semester than I expected</em>”, or “<em>I registered for too many classes this semester</em>” are <span class="emph">not</span> grounds for an extension.</p>
    <p>Extensions to due dates will not be granted simply to allow “porting” from one system to another. “<em>But I had it working on my home PC!</em>” is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
    <a id="academichonesty"/><h2 id="academic-honesty">7.2 Academic Honesty</h2><p>Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own work. If an assignment is <strong>explicitly</strong> described as a team assignment, it must be the work of the team members only.</p>
    <p>The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and to use his evaluation of the student’s understanding of the assignment and of the submitted solution as evidence of cheating. Violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Academic Integrity for consideration for possible punitive action.</p>
    <p>Students who contribute to violations by sharing their code/designs with others may be subject to the same penalties.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Students are expected to use standard Unix protection mechanisms (<code>chmod</code>) to  keep their assignments from being read by their classmates. Failure to do so will result in grade penalties, at the very least.</li>
</ul><p>This policy is <span class="emph">not</span> intended to prevent students from providing legitimate assistance to one another. Students are encouraged to seek/provide one another aid in learning to use the operating system, in issues pertaining to the programming language, or to general issues relating to the course subject matter.</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Students should avoid, however, explicit discussion of approaches to solving a particular programming assignment, and under no circumstances should students show one another their code for an ongoing assignment, nor discuss such code in detail.</p>
    
</blockquote><p><strong>Use of Online Resources</strong></p>
    <p>You may <strong>not</strong> post details of course assignments, projects, or tests at online Forums, Bulletin Boards, Homework sites, etc., soliciting help.</p>
    <p>You may use information that you have not solicited but have located, subject to the following restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s  ideas, you must cite your sources appropriately. Within code, such  citations appear in comments.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>&#x22ee;
double x = 23.0;
double xsqrt = sqrt(x);
// Search algorithm based upon code by S Zeil at
// https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
int loc = 0;
while (loc &lt; arraySize &amp;&amp; numbers[loc] &lt; xsqrt)
&#x22ee;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else’s  words (code), you must cite your sources appropriately <strong>and</strong> mark  the quoted text. Within code, such  citations appear in comments.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>&#x22ee;
double x = 23.0;
double xsqrt = sqrt(x);

// Begin quoted code from  S Zeil at
// https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
int loc = 0;
while (loc &lt; listLength &amp;&amp; list[loc] &lt; searchItem)
{
    ++loc;
}
// End quoted code

&#x22ee;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Failure to appropriately cite any such “found code” will be taken as evidence of plagiarism.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>The overall principle stated in the first sentence of this section remains in  effect. “Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own  work.” If the bulk of your assignment, project, test answer, etc., are  copied, even with appropriate citation, to the degree that, in the judgment of  the instructor, you have not demonstrated your own knowledge of the course  material, you will receive a zero for that submission.</p>
